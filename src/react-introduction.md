# React introduction

React is a library for building user interactive interfaces in a declarative way.

You can design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and 
render just the right components when your data changes.

Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

## Components

The building blocks of a React application are components.

Instead of using a template syntax, these components are directly written in JavaScript.
This way, you can use the full power of JavaScript to build logic into these components.

Think of components like certain parts of your application (like a header, a navigation, or a content area).

## Universal use cases

React is not limited to web applications, it can also be used in mobile applications and even on the server using Node.
