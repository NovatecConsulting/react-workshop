# Accessibility Basics

Users of the web can have several impairments. This can be temporary like a broken arm, situational like using a small screen, or a permanent impairment, for example blindness.

In order to build the web app in an inclusive way, there are several points to be taken care of:

- Color contrast
- Keyboard Navigation
- Provide alt text to images and other non-text-media.
- Provide a good structured HTML. Landmarks and Headlines help.
- Always provide which language you are using, via `lang` attribute

Users with visual impairments often use a screenreader to use their computer and the web.

On Mac OS, there is an integrated screenreader, called VoiceOver, which you can activate via Command + F5, which also provides a tutorial to walk through its features.

Windows (Versions 10 and up) also has a screen reader integrated, called Narrator. You can activate Narrator by pressing 
Windows logo key + Ctrl + Enter, which also provides you a walkthrough.
