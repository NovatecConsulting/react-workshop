# Your first React application

There are several ways how to start building with React. We'll mainly use [vite](https://vitejs.dev).

Vite is a JavaScript toolchain which handles bundling JavaScript and CSS as well as assets for you. It comes with a convenient development server and also provides build steps for creating an optimized build for production-use.

You can create a new project with NPM:

```sh
# Create a Vite React App
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react

# Create a Vite React App with TypeScript
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react-ts
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to work in the browser, there are also templates you can fork:

- [Vite React Application](https://vite.new/react)
- [Vite React Application with TypeScript](https://vite.new/react-ts)
